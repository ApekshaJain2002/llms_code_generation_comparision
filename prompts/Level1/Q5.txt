 Given an array of length N. Peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if 'arr[i]' is the peak element, 'arr[i - 1]' < 'arr[i]' and 'arr[i + 1]' < 'arr[i]'. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
Note: For the first element, the previous element should be considered as negative infinity as well as for the last element, the next element should be considered as negative infinity.
