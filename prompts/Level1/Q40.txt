Polycarp has an array of n(n is even) integers a1,a2,…,an. Polycarp conceived of a positive integer k. After that, Polycarp began performing the following operations on the array: take an index i (1≤i≤n) and reduce the number ai by k.

After Polycarp performed some (possibly zero) number of such operations, it turned out that all numbers in the array became the same. Find the maximum k at which such a situation is possible, or print −1 if such a number can be arbitrarily large.
