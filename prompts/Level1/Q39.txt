Once upon a time, Toma found himself in a binary cafe. It is a very popular and unusual place.

The cafe offers visitors k different delicious desserts. The desserts are numbered from 0 to kâˆ’1. The cost of the i-th dessert is 2^i coins, because it is a binary cafe! Toma is willing to spend no more than n coins on tasting desserts. At the same time, he is not interested in buying any dessert more than once, because one is enough to evaluate the taste.

In how many different ways can he buy several desserts (possibly zero) for tasting?

(for t test cases)
