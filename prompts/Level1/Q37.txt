You are given a binary string s(a string consisting only of 0-s and 1-s).
You can perform two types of operations on s:

1) delete one character from s. This operation costs 1 coin;
2) swap any pair of characters in s. This operation is free (costs 0 coins).

You can perform these operations any number of times and in any order.

Let's name a string you've got after performing operations above as t. The string t is good if for each I from 1 to |t| tiâ‰ si (|t| is the length of the string t). The empty string is always good. Note that you are comparing the resulting string t with the initial string s.

What is the minimum total cost to make the string t good?

(For t test cases)
