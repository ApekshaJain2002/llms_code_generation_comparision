Two players are playing a game with coins in their wallets. Player 1 has a coins, and Player 2 has b coins. They take turns, with Player 1 going first. On each turn, a player can either switch wallets with the other player or keep their own, then must remove one coin from their wallet. If a player has no coins left on their turn, they lose.

Question: If both players play optimally, who will win the game?
