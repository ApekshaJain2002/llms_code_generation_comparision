Given a string of length 4 with characters representing different types, determine the minimum number of operations required to change each character's state (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) so that all are in state 1, with the constraint that consecutive operations must be applied to different characters.

Output the minimum number of operations needed, or -1 if itâ€™s impossible.
