In a mystical kingdom, there exists a powerful binary string s, made up of magical symbols: only "0"s and "1"s. The kingdom’s wise ruler, tasked with restoring harmony, seeks to transform this string into a special “good” string t.

To create this good string t, it must follow a unique rule: each position in t must differ from the same position in the original string s. In other words, no character in t can match the character that originally appeared at that position in s. If the ruler succeeds, t will radiate a magic aura that brings peace to the kingdom.

The ruler has two magical abilities to achieve this transformation:

Vanish Spell: For 1 coin, the ruler can delete any character from s, gradually shaping it into the ideal string t.
Teleport Spell: The ruler can freely swap any two characters within s at no cost.

The ruler may cast these spells as often as necessary, but they wish to minimize the cost. Can you help the ruler determine the minimum number of coins required to transform s into a good string t? Remember, the empty string is considered “good” and costs nothing!
