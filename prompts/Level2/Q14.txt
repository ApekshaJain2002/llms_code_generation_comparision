Imagine youâ€™re navigating through a large grid in a sprawling castle. You start at the top-left corner of the castle and your goal is to reach the bottom-right corner. The only paths you can take are moving right or moving down.

The castle is represented as a grid, and you need to determine how many unique ways you can travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without stepping outside the grid.

For example, if the castle grid is 3x3 (3 rows and 3 columns), you need to figure out how many distinct paths you can take to get from the starting corner to the final corner of the castle, only moving to the right or downward.

Can you help navigate the castle and find the total number of unique paths to reach the end?
