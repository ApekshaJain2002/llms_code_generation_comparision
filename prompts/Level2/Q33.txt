You're an investor tracking the stock market over several days, with each day's price recorded in an array. You have the opportunity to make up to two trades, allowing you to maximize your profits by buying and selling stock twice. However, you canâ€™t hold more than one stock at a time, so you need to sell before you buy again.

Your challenge is to strategize these two trades to achieve the highest possible profit by carefully choosing the best days to buy and sell. What's the maximum profit you can make?
