In the vibrant town of Numeria, there lived a renowned artist named Aria. She was famous for her mesmerizing sculptures, each crafted from colorful stones collected from the nearby hills. One day, she decided to create a breathtaking installation that would showcase the beauty of her favorite stones.

Aria gathered n stones of various colors and sizes, placing them in a beautiful array. However, as she stepped back to admire her work, she noticed that the stones were not arranged in a way that highlighted their uniqueness. Some stones were larger than others, and their sizes were not in order, which diminished the overall effect she wanted to create.

Determined to showcase the stones' beauty, Aria thought about rearranging them. She knew that if she could arrange the stones in a strictly increasing order of size, each stone would shine brighter beside the next. She pondered whether it was possible to achieve this desired arrangement with the stones she had gathered.

With a heart full of hope, Aria wondered: Could she rearrange the stones to create a stunning display, where each stone was smaller than the one that followed?
