You were walking down the street and heard a sound. The sound was described by the string s
 consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin characters. Now you want to find out if the sound was a cat meowing.

For the sound to be a meowing, the string can only contain the letters 'm', 'e', 'o' and 'w', in either uppercase or lowercase. Also:

string must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'm' or 'M'
it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'e' or 'E'
it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'o' or 'O'
it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'w' or 'W', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end
For example, strings "meow", "mmmEeOWww", "MeOooOw" describe a meowing, but strings "Mweo", "MeO", "moew", "MmEW", "meowmeow" do not.

Determine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.
