Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. The cube with index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i-th cube showed the value ai(1≤ai≤100). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have changed after sorting).

For each test case, output:


"YES" if his favorite cube will definitely be removed,
"NO" if his favorite cube will definitely not be removed,
"MAYBE" if it's uncertain.
(For t test cases)
