Polycarp was a curious mathematician who loved playing with numbers. One day, he arranged an array of n integers, carefully lining them up in a neat row. To add a twist to his setup, he came up with a positive number k, a mysterious number that would help him transform his array.

He then set himself a strange goal: he wanted all the numbers in the array to become identical. To achieve this, Polycarp devised a rule. He could pick any number in the array and reduce it by k as many times as he wanted. Carefully choosing his moves, he aimed to see if he could make every element match exactly.

But a question lingered—what’s the largest value of k he could use to succeed in this quest? And was it even possible, or could the number k be infinitely large? Polycarp was determined to solve the puzzle, seeking the perfect k to make his array a harmonious line of identical numbers.
