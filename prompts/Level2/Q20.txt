Imagine youâ€™re a wizard trying to cast a powerful spell. The spell requires you to calculate the strength of a magical potion by raising a base amount of magic (x) to a certain power (n).

For example, if you have a magical base strength of 2.5 and you need to raise it to the power of 3, you need to determine the final strength of the potion after applying the spell.

Can you help the wizard by calculating the final strength of the potion ?
