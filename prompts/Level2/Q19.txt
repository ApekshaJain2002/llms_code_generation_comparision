Imagine youâ€™re a detective solving a mystery where two secret codes have been mixed up. You suspect that the two codes might be anagrams of each other. An anagram is a code that contains exactly the same letters as another code, but possibly in a different order.

For example, you have two secret codes: "listen" and "silent". Your job is to check if these two codes are anagrams of each other by comparing their letters.

Can you help solve the mystery by determining if the two codes are anagrams of each other, ensuring they contain the exact same letters?
