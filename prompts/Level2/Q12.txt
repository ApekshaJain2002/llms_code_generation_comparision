Imagine you’re a brave adventurer who has reached the base of a magical staircase. Each stair is enchanted and allows you to climb either one stair or two stairs at a time. Your quest is to figure out how many different ways you can reach the top of the staircase from the bottom.

Here’s the scenario:

You start at the 0th stair and need to reach the Nth stair.
For each step, you can either take a single step up or a double step up.
For example, if there are 4 stairs, you need to calculate how many distinct paths you can take to reach the 4th stair using steps of one or two stairs.

Can you help the adventurer find all the different ways to climb the stairs and reach the top of the magical staircase?
