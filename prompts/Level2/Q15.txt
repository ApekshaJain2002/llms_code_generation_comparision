Imagine you're organizing a grand party with a diverse range of guests, and each guest has a unique name tag. After the party, you want to tally how many guests had each name tag to see which names were the most popular.

Hereâ€™s the list of name tags (elements) from the party: [Alice, Bob, Alice, Charlie, Bob, Alice].

Can you count how many times each name tag appeared so you can make a list of the most common names?

In this case, you would need to determine the frequency of each name tag, such as:

Alice: 3 times
Bob: 2 times
Charlie: 1 time
Help organize the guest list and count the frequency of each name tag from the party!
