Imagine you’re in a game where you’re counting the longest streak of magical spells that worked perfectly. Each spell is represented by either a success (1) or a failure (0). Your task is to find the longest continuous streak of successful spells (1s) that happened in a row.

For example, if the sequence of spell results is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], you need to determine the length of the longest consecutive streak of successful spells.

Can you help find the longest sequence of consecutive successes to determine the most impressive streak of magical spells?
