In a distant land, there is a curious wizard who has discovered a magical array of numbers. The array, called a, has n elements, each holding a unique power level.

The wizard has a special goal: to make every element in one copy of the array equal so it radiates pure power. But there's a catchâ€”he can only use his magic in two specific ways:

1) Cloning Magic: The wizard can choose any array copy he has and create a new, identical copy of it. This allows him to have multiple versions of the same array, which he can then manipulate.

2) Swapping Spell: The wizard can swap any two elements between any two copies of the array, or within the same copy if he wishes.

The wizard wants to know the fewest number of spells he needs to cast to achieve his goal: a single copy of the array where all elements are the same. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations to reach this enchanted array of identical power levels?
