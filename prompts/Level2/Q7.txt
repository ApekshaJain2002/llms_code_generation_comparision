A group of adventurers are exploring a magical forest, where the paths between trees are connected in strange ways. 
Some paths loop back, trapping anyone who walks in circles. 
The adventurers want to know if the path they are following leads them back to a tree they've already visited, creating a cycle. 
If there's no cycle, they can keep exploring safely.
Imagine the forest as a series of connected trees, where each tree points to the next. 
Can you help the adventurers figure out if their current path leads them in a circle (cycle) or if it's safe to continue?
